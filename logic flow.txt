main
    key matrix connected to pi gpio through shift registers

    pi zero w runs python to send keypresses off to either bluetooth or local based on Toggle

    pi zero connected to 6502 through via chip
        register a sends keypress output from pi to 6502
        register b sends ascii text info from 6502 to pi
    
    python program on pi acts as a telnet window to talk to 6502

    python program on pi (service) listens to power circuit and sends shutdown signal to safely shutdown if toggle is turned off

    python program on pi to reprogram eeprom as needed (need to build an eeprom programming circuit, outside this system)

    python program on pi to switch 6502's sd card to pi to reprogram it

    pi gpio breaks out 8 pins onto cat5 connectors to easily connect up to breadboards for future trickery





    6502 connected to sd card through a via chip

    rom acts as boot loader to load os from sd card in chunks onto ram chip. easier to reprogram sd card

    assembly program on rom:
        enable sd card
        ask user if they want msbasic or sd card
            find first chunk of os from sd card and load to ram
            pass the torch on to sd card for instructions
    
    msbasic loaded onto rom

    6502 data buss and address buss broken out onto cat5 connectors to easily connect up to breadboards for future trickery

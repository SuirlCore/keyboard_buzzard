main
    key matrix connected to 6502

    6502 scans matrix and sends off to pi zero w

    pi zero w runs python to send keypresses off to either bluetooth or local based on Toggle

    pi zero interfaces with eeprom programmer to reprogram rom chip

------------------------------



key matrix:
    6x12 (keyboard) + 6x4 (10 key)

6502
    ram chip for programming
    rom chip for base firmware?
    chip to send data to pi?
    timer circuit
    reset switches

pi zero w
    power off circuit
        toggle sends shutdown command to pi
        toggle cuts main power, capacitor keeps power to pi for 10 seconds
    interface to control ram chip and reprogram
    interface for 8x gipo pins to send out to breadboard (cat5 connector on the outside of keyboard)


power source
    either usb wall ac, or usb battery
    circuitry to switch between (just swap plugs?)

3d prints
    sick mechanical keyboard
        edit for cat5 connection
        edit for pi and toggle enclosure
        edit for 6502 housing
    sick pad
    pi case (with spots for 2 toggle switches)
    key caps
    housing for 6502 related stuff


need to purchase:
    keys
        key switches
        diodes
    power circuit
        capacitor
        transistor
    microprocessor
        6502
        ram chip
        data send chip
        logic gate chips?
